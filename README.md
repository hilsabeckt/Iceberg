# Iceberg

*Work in Progress*

The idea of towing an iceberg to regions in Africa in order to provide fresh water has often been a thought experiment.
Using data from the National Oceanic and Atomospheric Administration, I hope to create a model that is capable of calculating optimal routes the iceberg could be towed that minimize the amount of freshwater lost via melting.
